# Password-Generator

A Project to create a password generator using upper, lower, numbers and special characters.

When you click the button on the page, it will ask you a series of quesions.

How many characters would you like? 8 is the minimum ammount and it goes up to 126 characters.

The alert drop down will ask do you want any uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters?

Click the commands you need and it will generate a password.

If for some reason, the generator will not accept anything less that 8 characters and if you quit out of the generator it will stop.
